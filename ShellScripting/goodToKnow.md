# Good to know

- use `set -x` to see the commands that are executed. `set -e` to stop the script if any command fails.

- To run the script in the background use `nohup ./script.sh &` for detached mode and `nohup ./script.sh` for foreground mode. this will run the script in the background and will continue running even if the terminal is closed and it will create a file called nohup.out in the current directory.

- To execute a script (script.sh) using at, you must specify when it should run. For example, at -f script.sh now + 10 minutes schedules it to execute in 10 minutes, while at -f script.sh 14:30 runs it at 2:30 PM. After scheduling, you can view pending jobs using atq, which lists scheduled tasks, and remove a job with atrm <job-number>.

- to setup root password, use `sudo passwd root`. type `exit` to exit from root user. for temporarily switch to user, use su - <username>.

- for loop splits the file content into space not new line where as while loop splits the file content into new line

- `$#` is the number of arguments passed to the script.
- echo `$?`# to check the previous command is success or not, 0 is success and 1 is failure

- The parentheses create a subshell, allowing multiple commands (echo and ls) to execute together as a single unit. The semicolon ; separates the two commands inside the subshell, ensuring they both run before redirecting output to the file. i.e. `(echo "Hello" ; ls) >> fileName`. without `()` then the two commands would be executed separately.

- Both `$(( ))` (arithmetic expansion) and the `let` keyword in Bash handle exit statuses similarly, determining their success or failure based on the result of the arithmetic expression. If the result is non-zero, the exit status is `0` (indicating success), and if the result is zero, the exit status is `1` (indicating failure). For example, in `$((5 > 3))`, the expression evaluates to true, so the exit status is `0`, while `$((3 > 5))` results in an exit status of `1`. The same logic applies to `let`. While `let` is functional, `$(( ))` is generally preferred for modern scripting due to its cleaner syntax, easier integration within scripts, and overall readability, making it the go-to choice for arithmetic operations in Bash.

- Use `>` when you want to start fresh and replace the file's contents. Use `>>` when you want to keep the existing content and add new data to the file.

- `;` separates commands, allowing multiple commands on one line. The `;;` terminates a block in a case statement, signaling its end.

- The shift command in shell scripting is used to shift the positional parameters of a script to the left, effectively discarding the first parameter ($1) and reassigning the rest. After using shift, the second parameter ($2) becomes $1, the third parameter ($3) becomes $2, and so on. If no arguments are left, $@ (all arguments) and $* (all arguments as a single string) become empty.

- The `/dev/null` file in Linux is a special "black hole" where unwanted output is discarded, making it useful for cleaning up noisy command executions. A common use case is redirecting standard output (`> /dev/null`) or both output and errors (`> /dev/null 2>&1`) to suppress command messages entirely, keeping logs or terminal output clean. Itâ€™s particularly handy in automation and scripting, where processes run in the background and unnecessary feedback is ignored for efficiency. For example, when checking internet connectivity using `ping`, redirecting the output to `/dev/null` ensures the command executes silently without cluttering the console. Similarly, background jobs (`command &> /dev/null &`) use it to prevent unnecessary logs while running tasks continuously. Essentially, `/dev/null` is an effective way to discard output, reduce noise, and streamline command-line operations.


## Difference between

- `$`and `@` in a bash script

  - The `$` character is used to represent a variable in a bash script, while the `@` character is used to represent an array in a bash script or a positional parameter in a bash script.

- `$()` and `${}` in a bash script

  - Use `$()` when you want to execute a command and use its result.

  - Use `${}` to manipulate variables or access values in a shell script.

## Syntax

- `(())` for arithmetic operations

- `[[ ]]` for string operations and conditionals. it is better than using `[]` because it supports regex and logical operators if we had to do this with `[]` then additional tooling would be required like grep for regex.
  `[[]]` prevents word splitting and pathname expansion, meaning it handles spaces and special characters in variables more safely: `file="my file.txt"
if [[ -f $file ]]; then
    echo "File exists!"
fi`
  With `[ ]`, you'd need to explicitly quote the variable ("$file") to avoid syntax errors.

- `#` for number operations or comments. i.e. `${#arr[*]}`
- `<<` for multiline comments.
- `-e` for escape sequences

### Difference between `<` and `>`

`<` (Redirection for Input):
The `<` operator is used to redirect the contents of a file as input to a command.

`Example:` done `<` file.txt
In this case, the `<` operator is feeding the contents of file.txt line by line to the while loop or command.

`>` (Redirection for Output):
The `>` operator writes or overwrites output to a file.
`Example`: `echo "Hello world" > file.txt`
This will write "Hello world" to file.txt, replacing any existing content in the file.

`>>` (Appending for Output):
If you're appending data to an existing file, use the `>>` operator instead of `>`.

`Example`: `echo "Hello world" >>file.txt`
This will add "Hello world" to the end of file.txt without erasing its current content.

### While loop

`IFS=`: The IFS (Internal Field Separator) is temporarily set to an empty value. This ensures that the line is read as-is, without splitting it into parts based on spaces or tabs.

`read -r line`: `read`: Reads a single line from the input (in this case, the file).

`-r`: Prevents backslashes (\) in the input from being treated as escape characters, ensuring the line is read literally.

`line`: This is a variable that stores the content of the current line being read.

- The redirection `(< "$FILE")` ensures that each of the lines above is read one at a time. Without `done < "$FILE"`, the loop wouldn't know what to process because it wouldn't have the file content as input.

- `Input Redirection (<)`: The `<` operator is used in bash to redirect the contents of a file as input for a command or script. In this case, it redirects the contents of `$FILE (your file path)` to the while loop.
  `$FILE`: This is a variable that holds the path to your file, which contains the data you want to process line by line.

- `done`: Marks the end of the while loop. At this point, all the instructions inside the loop block `(do ...)` have been executed for each line in the file. So, `done < "$FILE"` tells the shell: "Run this loop, and feed it the contents of the file specified by $FILE line by line as input."
