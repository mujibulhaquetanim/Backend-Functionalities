# Terraform Logs

This is a log file for Terraform. It contains information about the operations performed by Terraform. Here some generated files like terraform.tfstate, terraform.tfstate.backup, terraform.tfstate.lock.info, etc. added to .gitignore as they can contain sensitive information. These logs are generated by Terraform during the execution of commands like `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`, etc.

## terraform init

```tf
terraform init
Initializing the backend...
Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding hashicorp/aws versions matching "6.0.0-beta3"...
- Installing hashicorp/aws v6.0.0-beta3...
- Installed hashicorp/aws v6.0.0-beta3 (signed by HashiCorp)
Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

## terraform plan

```tf
terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
